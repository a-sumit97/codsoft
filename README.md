C++ Internship Projects

Welcome to my C++ internship projects repository! This repository includes three projects that I developed during my internship at CodSoft. For all these projects, different aspects of C++ programming were in focus that vary from basic operations to game development.
 
PROJECTS :

1. Number Guessing Game
In the project, I developed a number-guessing game where a player tries to guess a number that is generated randomly by the computer.

Features :
Number Generation: Used the rand function to generate random numbers between 1 and 100.
Input Handling: It was used to take the user's input regarding their guess for the number.
Guessing Referee, gives a reply about the guesses through "Too High," "Too Low, or the answer.

2. Simple Calculator
It is the basic calculator application that can help in simple arithmetic based on user's input.

Features : 

Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division
User Interface is very friendly
Error handling for invalid inputs

3. Tic Tac Toe Game
In this project, I have implemented the classical Tic Tac game where two players could play against each other.

Features :

3x3 Game Grid
Player Input Handling
Win, Lose, and Draw Conditions

Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, that's pretty simple.

Prerequisites
C++ compiler (for example, GCC, Clang)
Git
